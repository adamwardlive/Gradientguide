def calculate_distance(power, duration):
    # Simplified formula to convert power (watts) and duration (minutes) to distance (km)
    # This is a placeholder and should be replaced with a more accurate calculation
    speed = power / 100  # Simplified assumption: 100W = 1 km/h
    distance = speed * (duration / 60)  # Convert duration to hours and multiply by speed
    return distance
